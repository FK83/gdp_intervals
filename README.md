This repository contains replication files for the working paper "Prediction intervals for economic fixed-event forecasts" (Kr√ºger and Plett, 2023):

- "Section3_plot_rmsfe.R" plots the root mean squared forecast error (RMSFE) as a function of the forecast horizon

- "Section6_simulation.R" runs the simulation study of the paper, and saves the results in the subfolder "fe_sim/". "Section6_collect_results.R" collects the results in "fe_sim/" and makes the summary table in the paper.

- "Section7_main_results.R" runs the paper's main empirical analysis. The evaluation results are saved as "gdp_us_eval.csv", "inf_us_eval.csv" and "gdp_de_eval.csv". "Section7_hist_comparison.R" runs comparisons to the histogram-based prediction intervals (for US data). "Section7_zero_mean.R" runs a robustness check that sets the mean of the Gaussian model to zero.

- "gdp_procs23.R" collects several R functions that are used in the project. 

- "estimation.R" and "iso_icv_icx.cpp" contain code written by Alexander Henzi, for implementing the method by Henzi (Journal of Business and Economic Statistics 41, 2023). Posted with kind permission. 

- Subfolder "data/": "gdp_us.csv" and  "inf_us.csv" contain point forecasts and realizations of US GDP and inflation. "histograms_gdp.csv" and "individual_histograms_gdp.csv" contain average and individual-level prediction intervals (based on survey 'histograms') for US GDP; analogous files (with "gdp" replaced by "inf") are available for inflation. *Disclaimer note*: As detailed in the paper, these forecast and realization data files have been constructed from public sources (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Survey of Professional Forecasters and Real-Time Data Research Center). Of course, the original data providers cannot take responsibility for the accuracy of the data posted here. The original sources should be consulted for the official and most recent version of the data.
